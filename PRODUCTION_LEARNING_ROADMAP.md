## Milestone 1: Database Indexing

### Problem

Mobile playback APIs and CMS pages frequently query by device code, user ID, schedule date range, active status, and schedule-device relationships. Without indexes, these queries can become slow as data grows.

### Solution

Add indexes in `AppDbContext.OnModelCreating` for high-frequency lookup paths.

### Implementation Scope

- `Devices.DeviceCode` unique index.
- `Devices.UserId`.
- `Devices.IsActive`.
- `PlaybackSchedules.UserId`.
- `PlaybackSchedules.IsActive`.
- `PlaybackSchedules.StartDate`.
- `PlaybackSchedules.EndDate`.
- `PlaybackSchedules.CreatedAt`.
- Composite index: `PlaybackSchedules(IsActive, StartDate, EndDate)`.
- Composite index: `PlaybackSchedules(UserId, IsActive, CreatedAt)`.
- `PlaybackScheduleDevices.DeviceId`.
- `PlaybackScheduleDevices.PlaybackScheduleId`.
- Composite index: `PlaybackScheduleDevices(DeviceId, PlaybackScheduleId)`.
- `PlaybackScheduleItems.PlaybackScheduleId`.
- Composite index: `PlaybackScheduleItems(PlaybackScheduleId, OrderIndex)`.
- `Medias.UserId`.
- `Medias.UploadedAt`.

### Learning Outcome

- Understand relational index design.
- Learn how EF Core maps indexes for multi-provider databases.
- Learn the difference between single-column and composite indexes.

### CV Highlight

> Designed database indexes for high-frequency IoT device playback queries using EF Core and PostgreSQL.

### Status

Done

### Implementation Notes

- Added EF Core indexes in `Infrastructure/Persistence/AppDbContext.cs` for device lookup, schedule date filtering, schedule-device joins, ordered schedule items, and media/user queries.
- Added `Devices.ClaimCode` index as an extra optimization because the claim flow validates claim codes during device assignment.
- These model indexes are automatically created for new databases. Existing databases may need EF Core migrations or provider-specific index repair scripts to apply them.

---

## Milestone 2: Mobile Query Optimization

### Problem

Mobile APIs are read-heavy and may load more EF entities than needed. Tracking read-only entities adds unnecessary overhead.

### Solution

Optimize mobile API queries with `AsNoTracking()`, focused includes, and projection where appropriate.

### Implementation Scope

- Update `MobilePlaybackService.GetDeviceAsync` to use `AsNoTracking()`.
- Update `MobilePlaybackService.GetPlaybackStateAsync` to use `AsNoTracking()` for read-only schedule queries.
- Review whether schedule lookup can query from `PlaybackScheduleDevices` directly.
- Keep `HeartbeatAsync` tracked because it updates `LastSeen`.

### Learning Outcome

- Learn EF Core tracking vs no-tracking queries.
- Learn projection-based optimization.
- Understand query shape and payload size.

### CV Highlight

> Optimized EF Core read paths with no-tracking queries for high-frequency mobile API endpoints.

### Status

Done

### Implementation Notes

- Added `AsNoTracking()` to read-only mobile queries in `Application/Services/MobilePlaybackService.cs`.
- Kept `HeartbeatAsync` tracked because it updates `Device.LastSeen` and calls `SaveChangesAsync()`.
- This milestone covers mobile API read paths first because device polling is the highest-frequency workload. A later web/admin read optimization pass can apply the same idea to CMS list/dashboard pages.

---

## Milestone 3: Redis Playback Cache

### Problem

100-200 devices polling `/api/mobile/playback-state/{deviceCode}` can repeatedly hit PostgreSQL even when schedule data has not changed.

### Solution

Use Redis with a cache-aside pattern for playback-state responses.

### Implementation Scope

- Add Redis config:

```json
{
  "Redis": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "ConnectionString": "localhost:6379"
  }
}
```

- Add cache abstraction:
  - `ICacheService`
  - `RedisCacheService`
  - optional `NullCacheService` fallback
- Cache key: `mobile:playback-state:{deviceCode}`.
- Suggested TTL:
  - active schedule: 5 seconds
  - no active schedule: 10 seconds
  - unclaimed device: 10-30 seconds
- Log cache hit/miss.

### Learning Outcome

- Learn Redis basics.
- Learn distributed caching and TTL.
- Learn cache-aside pattern.

### CV Highlight

> Implemented Redis cache-aside strategy for high-frequency mobile playback APIs, reducing database pressure with TTL-based caching.

### Status

Planned

---

## Milestone 4: Redis Device Presence

### Problem

Heartbeat writes can overload the database if every device updates `LastSeen` frequently.

### Solution

Use Redis TTL keys for realtime online/offline presence and throttle durable DB writes.

### Implementation Scope

- On heartbeat, set Redis key: `device:online:{deviceCode}`.
- TTL: 3-5 minutes.
- Update database `LastSeen` only if the previous value is older than 30-60 seconds.
- Keep DB `LastSeen` for durable history.
- Optional later: dashboard online/offline reads from Redis.

### Learning Outcome

- Learn Redis TTL as presence tracking.
- Learn write throttling.
- Understand realtime state vs durable state.

### CV Highlight

> Built Redis TTL-based presence tracking for IoT-style device heartbeat and reduced persistent database writes.

### Status

Planned

---

## Milestone 5: Mobile API Rate Limiting

### Problem

Buggy device clients or retry storms can overload mobile APIs.

### Solution

Add endpoint-specific rate limiting for mobile APIs.

### Implementation Scope

- Use ASP.NET Core built-in RateLimiter.
- Protect:
  - `/api/mobile/heartbeat`
  - `/api/mobile/playback-state/{deviceCode}`
  - `/api/mobile/devices/{deviceCode}`
- Suggested policies:
  - heartbeat: 10 requests/minute/device
  - playback-state: 20 requests/minute/device
  - device info: 20 requests/minute/device
- Prefer partition key by `deviceCode`, not only IP.
- Start with in-memory limiter; later consider Redis-backed distributed limiter.

### Learning Outcome

- Learn API protection strategies.
- Learn fixed-window/sliding-window/token-bucket concepts.
- Understand NAT/IP limitations for device fleets.

### CV Highlight

> Implemented endpoint-specific rate limiting to protect mobile device APIs from retry storms and misbehaving clients.

### Status

Planned

## Milestone 6: RabbitMQ Infrastructure

### Problem

Some work should not happen synchronously during HTTP requests, such as media metadata processing and schedule-related cache invalidation.

### Solution

Introduce RabbitMQ for asynchronous event-driven processing.

### Implementation Scope

- Add RabbitMQ to local Docker Compose.
- Add message publisher abstraction:
  - `IMessagePublisher`
  - `RabbitMqMessagePublisher`
- Define event contracts:
  - `VideoUploadedEvent`
  - `ScheduleChangedEvent`
- Initial queues:
  - `video.uploaded`
  - `schedule.changed`
  - dead-letter queue later

### Learning Outcome

- Learn queues, exchanges, routing keys, durable messages.
- Learn event-driven backend design.
- Learn failure and retry concepts.

### CV Highlight

> Added RabbitMQ-based event infrastructure for asynchronous backend workflows.

### Status

Planned

---

## Milestone 7: Worker Service

### Problem

Background jobs should be independently scalable and isolated from web request handling.

### Solution

Create a .NET Worker Service to consume RabbitMQ events.

### Implementation Scope

- Add project: `VendingAdWorker`.
- Optionally add shared contracts project later.
- Worker responsibilities:
  - consume queue messages
  - process jobs
  - update PostgreSQL
  - invalidate Redis cache
  - log failures

### Learning Outcome

- Learn .NET Worker Service.
- Learn service separation.
- Learn long-running process deployment.

### CV Highlight

> Separated web API and background worker services for scalable asynchronous processing.

### Status

Planned

---

## Milestone 8: Schedule Cache Invalidation

### Problem

Redis playback cache may serve stale schedule data until TTL expires.

### Solution

Publish `ScheduleChangedEvent` when schedules change, then worker invalidates Redis cache for affected devices.

### Implementation Scope

- Publish event after:
  - create schedule
  - create immediate schedule
  - update schedule
  - toggle schedule
  - delete schedule
  - add/remove/reorder schedule items
- Event fields:
  - `ScheduleId`
  - `UserId`
  - `DeviceCodes`
  - `ChangedAtUtc`
  - `ChangeType`
- Worker deletes keys:
  - `mobile:playback-state:{deviceCode}`

### Learning Outcome

- Learn event-driven cache invalidation.
- Understand consistency tradeoffs between TTL and invalidation.

### CV Highlight

> Implemented event-driven Redis cache invalidation for device playback schedules using RabbitMQ.

### Status

Planned

## Milestone 9: Video Metadata Pipeline

### Problem

Video metadata extraction can be slow and should not block upload requests.

### Solution

Publish `VideoUploadedEvent` after upload and process metadata asynchronously in the worker.

### Implementation Scope

- Add fields to `Media` when needed:
  - `Checksum`
  - `ProcessingStatus`
  - `ProcessedAt`
  - optional `ContentType`
- Worker tasks:
  - calculate SHA256 checksum
  - extract duration with FFmpeg/ffprobe later
  - update media metadata
- Start small with checksum/status, then add duration.

### Learning Outcome

- Learn background media processing.
- Learn idempotent job processing.
- Learn checksum validation.

### CV Highlight

> Built asynchronous video metadata processing with RabbitMQ and .NET Worker Service.

### Status

Planned

---

## Milestone 10: Object Storage And CDN

### Problem

ASP.NET web servers should not serve large video files to many devices. Local uploads can be lost or inconsistent across deployments/instances.

### Solution

Move video files to object storage and deliver them through CDN/object storage URLs.

### Implementation Scope

- Add interface:

```csharp
public interface IFileStorageService
{
    Task<FileUploadResult> UploadAsync(Stream stream, string fileName, string contentType);
    Task DeleteAsync(string objectKey);
}
```

- Implement providers:
  - `LocalFileStorageService`
  - `S3CompatibleFileStorageService`
- Config switch:
  - `Storage:Provider = Local | S3 | R2`
- Recommended providers:
  - Cloudflare R2 for low-cost personal production
  - AWS S3 + CloudFront for enterprise-style CV value

### Learning Outcome

- Learn object storage.
- Learn CDN-backed file delivery.

## Milestone 11: Observability

### Problem

When production issues happen, logs and health checks are needed to locate bottlenecks across API, DB, Redis, RabbitMQ, and storage.

### Solution

Add structured logging, health checks, and optional tracing/metrics.

### Implementation Scope

- Add Serilog.
- Add health endpoints:
  - `/health/live`
  - `/health/ready`
- Health checks:
  - PostgreSQL
  - Redis
  - RabbitMQ
  - storage config later
- Optional tools:
